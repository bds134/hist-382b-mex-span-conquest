## Course Description

This course explores the Spanish Conquest of Mexico by means of original sixteenth-century texts, images, and maps. Key themes include war, mass mortality, race, and religion, as well as the mixing of New and Old World literary genres and ways of writing/painting.

We examine how traditional conquest narratives have been challenged by new sources and interpretive frameworks, questioning heroic accounts and exploring the conquest through indigenous perspectives. The central question driving our inquiry: To what degree have advances in reading the Conquest through indigenous eyes eroded the notion of a Spanish conquest itself?
